# Markdown Header & Footer Template
This is a Markdown template that **provides header and footer**.

You can customize your own template by changing 
- title
- logo 
- motto
- semester
- course
- Anyway you want!

## Tips
1. You should write your notes in "./note.md"
2. There COULD BE some delay for the html to react after you change the template file.
3. **Please note that you need to generate a ***base64*** code for your picture when changing the logo.**
4. You can refer to this website for questions on $\LaTeX$ Formula outputs. https://blog.csdn.net/HollyRan/article/details/115768326
